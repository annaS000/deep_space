# Data Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
This analysis is being used to help Louise, a playwrite, start a crowdfunding campaign for her upcoming play **_Fever_**, estimating her budget to be over $10,000. We will be using Excel to analyze current data to help her gain a better understanding of how campaigns operate from start to end.
## Goal
The goal is to give Louise accurate information backed by our research to set up her campaign for success. This can be done by gathering data from other campaigns on the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and conducting an analysis on different variables using tables and charts to find trends that can affect the outcome. These results can be used as a guide for what makes an effective and profitable campaign.
