# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**
>The goal of this project is to continue our analysis of [Kickstarter data](https://github.com/annaS000/mywork/blob/main/challenges/kickstarter/Kickstarter_Challenge%20copy.xlsx) for the playwright, Louise. First, we helped her start a crowdfunding campaign for her play **_Fever_**, with an estimated budget to be **over $10,000**. That analysis included giving Louise accurate information/recommendations backed by research to set up her campaign for success. This was done by gathering data from other campaigns on the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and conducting an analysis on different variables using tables and charts to find trends that can affect the outcome. These results were used as guidelines for what makes an effective and profitable campaign.
Now that Louise has raised close to her funding goal in a short time frame, she has come to us again to find out how other campaigns turned out in relation to their **launch dates** and **funding goals**. We will submit a written analysis along with visualizations.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
I will now walk through the process I took to analyze this data for Louise.

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**
To begin the analysis of campaign launch dates, I created a line graph that displays the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns throughout the months of the year.

### Chart 1:
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annaS000/mywork/main/challenges/kickstarter/resources/Theater_Outcome_vs_Launch.png)

 >Here, you can see there is a very obvious peak of 111 cases in successes during the month of May  followed by decline for the rest of the summer months. There is also a slight increase in October just to decline again after. I found this to be interesting so, I used the **Years** filter to see if this was a common occurrence throughout the years.

### Chart 2:

>I broke up the data into two smaller intervals of years to see if I would yield similar results

### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**
* The biggest challenge I encountered was figuring out how I wanted to word the conclusions for this analysis. Most of my experience for analyzing data comes from statistic classes in college where I would have to conduct a some kind of hypothesis testing to support any claims. Since the challenge only asks us to make two charts to form our opinions, I felt very limited on what I could say with confidence. There are many variables that affect the outcomes of these campaigns. When making any statements about data, I want to make sure what I am saying is not misleading in anyway. I decided to create a few more charts for my analysis to get a better understanding of the data as well as reformatting the original charts I made. This helped me get a clearer picture.  
* Additionally, deciding how I was going to format my graphs was a challenge for me. I spent hours deciding how I wanted them to look. This was not required for the project but, I like to make my work look pleasing to the audience. Furthermore, when I am providing evidence for my claims, I want to make sure the graph I am presenting reflects what I am saying. So, I found a few books on portraying data to help me represent my results and another for using Markdown.

3. What are some limitations of this dataset? 

    * While this data set has many variables that I can spend a long time comparing and analyzing, I did notice a few limitations. Starting with the 'goal' and 'pledged' columns, the data points here are labeled with the $ symbol but, a few columns down we can see some of these points are not supposed to be USD. Since there is a mix of different currencies in this data set, I am not sure if they have been converted to USD to make accurate comparisons. Currencies from different countries often vary in value. For example, what might be considered a lot of money in the US may not be a lot somewhere else in the world. 

    * Another limitation of this data is the genres of the plays we are using are not readily available. I suppose we can go through the blurbs of each title and decide but, it would be very useful to be able to have a column with that information. 
4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
